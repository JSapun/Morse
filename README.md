# Morse Code Decoder Game

This project was built using the Vivado Design Suite to program the Basys 3 Board using VHDL. The implementation and complete project report can be found [here](https://justinsapun.com/pages/sub_engs/morse_decoder_game.html). The game was built to give users a fun way to learn and practice their Morse code skills by generating letters and visualizing their attempts with VGA.
